- **Trend analysis**: Performance trend tracking
- **Dashboard data**: Comprehensive system health overview

**Key Features:**
- Real-time performance snapshots
- Automated health score calculation
- Critical alert detection and notification
- Performance trend analysis
- Uptime and system metrics tracking

## Integration Points

### Main Application (`lib/main.dart`)
```dart
// Initialize all new monitoring services
await ProductionLoggingService().initialize();
await AdvancedCacheService().initialize();
await PerformanceTestingService().initialize();
await MonitoringDashboardService().initialize();
```

### Dependency Injection (`lib/injection_container.dart`)
- Registered all new services as singletons
- Proper dependency management
- Service lifecycle handling

### Error Tracking Integration
- Enhanced `ErrorTrackingService` with statistics API
- Integrated with monitoring dashboard
- Error trend analysis and reporting

## Performance Optimizations Applied

### 1. Memory Management
- Added missing methods to `MemoryManager`:
  - `getCurrentMemoryUsage()`: Returns current memory usage in bytes
  - `getMemoryStatistics()`: Comprehensive memory stats
- Fixed memory cleanup method calls
- Proper garbage collection handling

### 2. Error Tracking Enhancements
- Added `getErrorStatistics()` method
- Error severity grouping
- Error rate trend calculation
- Comprehensive error analytics

### 3. Code Quality Improvements
- Fixed all analyzer warnings and errors
- Proper curly braces in control flow statements
- Optimized string interpolation
- Debug-only console printing
- Final field declarations where appropriate

## Quality Assurance

### Analyzer Results
- **Before**: 269 issues (6 errors, 263 warnings)
- **After**: 0 issues in production code
- All errors resolved and warnings addressed

### Build Verification
- Debug APK builds successfully
- All services compile without errors
- No runtime compilation issues

### Code Coverage
- All new services fully implemented
- Comprehensive error handling
- Proper resource cleanup and disposal

## Performance Metrics

### Memory Optimization
- Automatic memory cleanup every 2 minutes
